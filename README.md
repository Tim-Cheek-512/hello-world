Hey there!
I'm Tim, im 23 and am currrently pursuing a degree in Finance. Learning to code to Develop web based applications has really started to grab my interest this semester. I have a little experience with Engineering and computer science from former high school and college courses, and have been learning what I can about the world of web Development. Slowly, but surely I'm getting a base of knowledge together in order to learn more efficiently, and more in depth.
